We created a testing repository that handles a list of manifests and allows to change the Dash.js player settings.

Steps would be:
1. Clone the repo
2. <code>cd tests-ui</code>
3. <code>npm install</code>
4. <code>npm run dev</code>

This will give you the Dash.JS content steering test page with our compiled version of the Dash.js player (based on branch https://github.com/qualabs/dash.js/tree/feature/cmcd-content-steering-reporting).

It has preloaded the 16 MPDs of the test cases described in the document.
